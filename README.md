## About this project

PolicyManager (Aka GDPR RAILS) was created with flexibility in mind to comply the requirements of GDPR ([General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/)). It's currently being developed at preyproject and will be battle-tested on [preyproject.com](https://preyproject.com) from May 25th.

### Main Features:

#### Policy Rules
+ Configurable policy rules, supports activerecord validations for new or existing users
+ Supports session-less consent policies which will be persisted once user signs in or signs up
+ Versioning system for new policies
+ Json endpoints to handle pending policies and portability logic in order to be implemented for client interfaces, ie: frontend apps like React, Vue, Backbone, you name it.

#### Portability
Portability module let's you define export options, this will generate a navegable static site with all the data
+ Seamless data export with configurable templates
+ Configurable Mailer templates for progress & completion download
+ Downloads images to local filesystem in order to comply GDPR requirements on accesibility of data.
+ Zip all the information and delivers it with a expirable download link
+ ActiveJob to handle the process
+ Behind the scenes uses a paperclip gem in which you can set up storages, like S3, Google

#### Forgotability
+ TBD, for now we simply delete all the data when user closes account. But this could be handled in the future like encription of emails or other sensible fields on database

### Admin Panel

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile: 

as `gem 'gdpr_rails'`

Then in yout application.rb require the policy_manager lib with 

`require "policy_manager"`

Install & run the migrations

`rake policy_manager:install:migrations`

## Usage examples

In order for this engine to work you must supply some rules according to your needs, in order to be in comply with GDPR you will need 3 rules at least. A cookie consent, a Privacy& TOS and a Age +16 confirmation. 
So, let's start doing that 

### Term rules

In your app router add the following:

```ruby
  mount PolicyManager::Engine => "/policies"
```

Then add an initializer, `config/initializers/gdpr.rb` and inside it set your policy rules.

```ruby
PolicyManager::Config.setup do |c|
  c.add_rule({name: "cookie", sessionless: true }  )
  c.add_rule({name: "age", validates_on: [:create, :update], blocking: true })
  c.add_rule({name: "privacy_terms", validates_on: [:create, :update], blocking: true })
end

# If you are using devise, you must extend engines's controller with devise helpers in order to get current_user
PolicyManager::UserTermsController.send(:include, Devise::Controllers::Helpers)
```

### Policy rules:

+ **sessionless:** will allow rules to be available for non logged users, if accepted a cookie `cookies["policy_rule_cookie"]` will be generated. If then the user sign in or signs up you could get this cookie and persist in database.
**Use this in your controller**
```ruby
@user.store_policy_cookie if cookies["policy_rule_cookie"] == "accepted"
```

+ **validates_on:** will require users validation, will automagically create virtual attributes for the policy you set, so, if you set `age` in your config you must supply in your forms a `policy_rule_age` checkbox in your form, if you don't supply those then the user validation will return errors on `policy_rule_age` . Also don't forget to add the fields in your strong params in the controller which handles the request.
+ **if:** you can add conditions as a Proc in order skip validations:
```ruby
  c.add_rule({name: "age", validates_on: [:create, :update], 
              if: ->(o){ o.enabled_for_validation } })
```

#### Policy handling:

There are some endpoints that will handle json in order to interact with client applications, like react interfaces, $.ajax etc. 
Also you can use the web html panel directly from the engine.
So, if the Engine was mounted on `/policies` then your routes will be:

    pending_user_terms          GET    /user_terms/pending(.:format)                     policy_manager/user_terms#pending
    accept_multiples_user_terms PUT    /user_terms/accept_multiples(.:format)            policy_manager/user_terms#accept_multiples
    blocking_terms_user_terms   GET    /user_terms/blocking_terms(.:format)              policy_manager/user_terms#blocking_terms
    accept_user_term            PUT    /user_terms/:id/accept(.:format)                  policy_manager/user_terms#accept
    reject_user_term            PUT    /user_terms/:id/reject(.:format)                  policy_manager/user_terms#reject
    user_terms                  GET    /user_terms(.:format)                             policy_manager/user_terms#index
    user_term                   GET    /user_terms/:id(.:format)                         policy_manager/user_terms#show

### Portability Rules

Export option & Portability rules will allow you to set up how and which data you will give to requester user.

#### Exporter:
+ **path**: where the folder will be generated, usually can be set on /tmp, this will need a pathname, like `Rails.root.join("tmp/export")`
+ **resource**: which model , ie: `User`
+ **index_template**: The first page. defaults to a simple ul li list of links tied to your rules, this expects a Pathname or a String with yout template
+ **layout**: A layout template to wrap the static site,  this expects a Pathname or a String with yout template
+ **after_zip**: a callback to handle the zip file on the resource, something like: 
```ruby
after_zip: ->(zip_path, resource){ 
  puts "THIS IS GREAT #{zip_path} was zipped, now what ??" 
}   
```

+ **mail_helpers**:  If you have some helpers you want to add to the mailers, then you can pass an Array of helpers, `[MailHelper, OtherMailHelper]`,
+ **attachment_path**: Paperclip upload path , defaults to "portability/:id/build.zip",
+ **attachment_storage**: Paperclip storage, defaults to filesystem , you can set `s3` or `google` or whatever paperclip supports
+ **expiration_link**: integer, defaults to 60 (1 minute),

#### Portability Rules:

Portability rules collection render. This will call a @user.articles
and will auto paginate records

```ruby
PolicyManager::Config.setup do |c|

  # minimal exporter setup
  c.exporter = { 
    path: Rails.root + "tmp/export", 
    resource: User 
  }

  # portability rules, collection render. This will call a @user.articles
  # and will auto paginate records
  # template expects a string or path
  c.add_portability_rule({
    name: "exportable_data", 
    collection: :articles, 
    template: "hello, a collection will be rendered here use @collection.to_json",
    per: 10
  })

  # portability rules, member render. This will call a @user.account_data
  # template expects a string or path
  c.add_portability_rule({
    name: "my_account", 
    member: :account_data,
    template: "hellow , here a resource will be rendered <%= @member.to_json %> "          
  })

end
```
**Important:**
> If the content that will be delivered has images use the `image_tag`
> in your template.  This helper was reimplemented in order for the remote image will be downloaded automatically.
> And will be served locally in order to be in compliant with the
> Portability data requirements.
